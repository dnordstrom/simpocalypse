# Welcome to Simpocalypse

A lil' practice project to learn React and Redux, based on the almighty [ERB](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate).

Relevant files are mostly in `app/containers`, `app/components`, `app/actions`,
`app/reducers`.

Very basic shit.

`yarn` to install dependencies, `yarn dev` to run, `yarn package` to build.
